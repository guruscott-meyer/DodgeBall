*** DODGEBALL ***
Dodgeball is a 1st person 3D game where you run around picking up little red balls and throwing them at a series of targets, or mobs, all while dodging the little red balls that the mobs are throwing back at you.

For the most part, I have endeavored to adhere to the rules of Dodgeball except as noted:
1) The game is 5-vs-1. Mobs only need be hit once to be eliminated, while the player must be hit 5 times.
2) The ball is still live after hitting a mob. This allows you to make bank shots and hit multiple mobs with one throw. Have fun!
3) I will probably change this, but the ball is still live after hitting the player as well. This means you can catch a ball after it has hit you and eliminate the thrower.
4) The circle on the ground indicates the player's feet. If the circle is over the line, the player's feet will be considered over the line.
